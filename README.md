### Overview
Implementation of algorithms from [Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction (2nd Edition) by Richard Sutton and Andrew Barto](http://incompleteideas.net/book/bookdraft2018mar21.pdf) and [David Silver's Reinforcement Learning Course](http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/d.silver/web/Teaching.html)

Each folder in corresponds to one or more chapters of the above textbook and/or course.

Code is written in Python 3 and uses RL environments from [OpenAI Gym](https://gym.openai.com/). Advanced techniques use [PyTorch](https://www.tensorflow.org/) for neural network implementations.
